Documentation of 3D Doctor Room

In this Environment, we have created all the models separatedly, all the models are reuseable and it's depends upon us that how we can use and place in the environment.
we have created multiple props for this environment. You can use your own environment by using these props.
Models are made with only 1 texture. The 3D 3D Doctor Room Pack consists of different objects created individually, so you can use them to create an intuitive and eye-catching 
user interface for your 3D game or animated video. The vectors can be edited and placed at any scene in the game/video to give it a more defined look.
